## Session Information

### DuPSUG Announcements

Informational session about the event, agenda of the evening future events and updates from the PowerShell world. We will announce the next virtual edition of DuPSUG here and we will be happy to hear your feedback about what content, which sessions or even which speakers you would like to see at future editions of our virtual user group.

### DevOps Nirvana with Azure Pipelines

In this session Daan will take us through how he achieved DevOps Nirvana by applying CI/CD principles with Azure Pipelines.

### Azure DevOps with Databases For People In A Hurry

DevOps with databases is considered a concept that takes a lot of effort. Actually the opposite is true. If you use the right tools and methods you can achieve this in a very short period of time. I‚Äôm always in a hurry and don‚Äôt want to spend a lot of time doing repetitive tasks.

We will learn how to generate a SSDT solution, basic unit tests and implement the solution into Azure DevOps. Come to this session to learn how to easy of the transition from databases without source control to fully tested in a matter of minutes.

### Cross-Platform Goodness with the WSL
The WSL running in Windows can be a great tool for people who need the best of both worlds, for everyday administration to cross-platform testing of apps and code. We will take a deep look at WSL, highlight some of the new v2 features, and do some real world work that will show how having Linux and Windows together can be a very beneficial toolset.
